The blue belt is set up to teach a little bit more Javascript than the orange belt. Using JS to manipulate the dom. This will be their last piece of JS for the course. After finishing this they can start in the JS course if they show interest.

## Time
These projects are pretty quick and usually take 1 class period each.

## Ages/Experience
For the more visually inclined students these projects might be a bit more difficult or boring

# Common-problems:
    1) Spelling onclick wrong
    2) Putting id="" between the tags instead of inside the opening tag
    3) Spelling variables incorrectly
    4) Common add-ons are to translate every single word that is typed, basically rebuilding Google translate, this is not inside the scope of what a student can do.
